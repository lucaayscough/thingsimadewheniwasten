David K: [1:17:30 PM] Welcome to our real-time support chat. How can I help you today?
Bob: [1:17:30 PM] Hi how can I delete my account and get back my money?
David K: [1:17:44 PM] All cancellations need to be done through email.


The 2 steps to do this are:


1. Cancel AUTO-RENEW function on-line
2. Email Refunds Dept. to CLOSE ACCOUNT and issue refund 


1. Cancel Auto-renew function


- Send an email requesting the cancellation to: cancel@justhost.com
- You will get an email with a link you will need to click on. You will need to follow the steps in that link.
- THIS IS IMPORTANT: One of the steps is confusing about your account being renewed. This step is to confirm that the account will NOT be renewed.
- There is also a step on the cancellation form (before step 4) that you need to select a check box and leave a comment to complete the step. This needs to be done or the account will not be canceled. 


2. Close the Current Account and request a refund of remaining amount


Send a final email to: refunds@justhost.com requesting cancellation of current account and requesting refund. Include in this email:


-The steps taken above (so they don't refer you back)
-Username, password, last four digits of card (for account verification)
-Method of refunding (if a new card, include the new number)
