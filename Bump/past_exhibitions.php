		<h2>Richard Ashrowan</h2><br />
		<b>Mutus Floris</b> (mute or silent flowers) is composed of over 5000 
		individual photographs of wild flowers taken over three seasons, 
		at Phenzhopehaugh in Scotland. The work explores our perceptual 
		relationship to natural things - flowers as objects of attention, the 
		fixing of dynamic life in symbolic thought. The soundtrack consists 
		of the botanical Latin names of the plants found, read by Crinan 
		Alexander, a leading expert in plant taxonomy. We hear the fixing 
		of perceptual experience in naming, a process of sampling and 
		classifying which nonetheless goes beyond its own conventions 
		in evoking the poetic.<br /><br />
		Bump Gallery 26th and 27th August 2011<br /><br />
		First shown at The Generator Shed, Scottish Borders, from 7th 
		May to 15th May 2011 - an experiment in extreme rural exhibiting - 
		download the invite and directions.<br /><br />
		Also shown at Montreal Underground Film Festival 14th May 2011.<br /><br />
