Dear Mr Ayscough,

Thank you for choosing 1&1 - your trusted and reliable domains, web
hosting, e-commerce and server hosting provider. Please find below,
important information about your 1&1 package and the 1&1 Control Panel.

==================================
1&1 Control Panel
==================================
The 1&1 Control Panel is your secure work area, from where you can manage
and configure your package features. Please note that Your 1&1 Control
Panel will be ready to use one hour after completing the order process.

Log in to your 1&1 Control Panel at https://admin.1and1.co.uk, using your
Account Number and the password you chose during the order process. Once
a domain name in your package is fully set up, you may log in with your
domain name instead of your Account Number.

The Control Panel is divided into several sections, featuring tools with
which you can set up your website. The Websites & Applications section
offers useful tools in setting up and building your websites. In the
Webspace & Access section, you will find tools for uploading and
downloading files to your webspace. The Marketing section provides you
with tools, with which you can drive traffic to your website. 

Take your time to explore the Control Panel and take advantage of the
selected tools to achieve success with your Internet presence.

===================================
Your Domains 
===================================
If you ordered a domain, it will be ready in about 12 hours for limited
configuration in your 1&1 Control Panel and will be fully available for
all configuration options in about 24 hours. View the status of your
domain, by selecting the package containing the domain on the "Package
Overview" page and on 'Administration' page, click on 'Domains'. 

A default holding page is automatically generated and will be displayed
for each of your domains. For Linux Hosting packages the file is named
'index.html' and 'Default.htm' for Microsoft Hosting. If you wish to
change this page, create and upload a new file with the same name. You
may also remove it entirely.

Depending on your package plan, at least five free subdomains are
included in your package.
